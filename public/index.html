<!-- Implement a spreadsheet. The spreadsheet can be represented by a data type of your choosing, but it should be easy to get/update individual cells as well as display the entire spreadsheet.
Each cell in the spreadsheet can have one of the following:
  - a string such as "Name" in A1 or "John Doe" in A2
  - a number such as 263 in B1 or 75 in B2
  - a formula linking other items in the spreadsheet. Ex: "=C1*C2" in D2 or "=C1+C2" in D3
    - cells that reference other cells with formulas are said to have dependencies. If the value in C1 or C2 changes, D2 will also need to be updated since it depends on those inputs.

In React, complete the following:
- initialize the data structure storing your spreadsheet
- develop a UI with a text field and submit button to add a cell to your spread sheet
- display the contents of the spreadsheet, with a checkbox for the "raw" values (i.e. "=A1+A2") or computed value (i.e. "12")

Assumptions:
- assume the spreadsheet is initialized with 26 columns, 100 rows
- assume valid input (no error checking on input)
- assume that if a string begins with a '=', it's a valid formula
- assume we just want to handle simple arithmetic for now (+-*/) only between two cells like '=B1*B2' or '=A1+A2'

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
